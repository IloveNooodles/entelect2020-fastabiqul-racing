# overdrive-bot

## Welcome to fastabiqul-racing-bot

This project was made to fulfill Tubes 1 Algorithm Strategies

## General Information

This is a bot that is meant to play Overdrive, a game made for Entelect Challenge 2020. More about that here: [Entelect Challenge](https://github.com/EntelectChallenge/2020-Overdrive)

This bot was made using Greedy Algorithm approach, where we prioritize speed above (almost) everything, collecting all em boosts we could, with a few secret recipes here and there to punish enemies with EMP while we are behind.

## Program Requirements

- JDK 1.8
- Apache Maven

## How to build

This bot has come prebuilt with the .jar file that you can find in the bin directory. But, if you want to build it yourself, you can use Maven.

To run the game-engine, use the game runner provided in the starter-pack of Entelect Challenge. You can download it here: [starter-pack](https://github.com/EntelectChallenge/2020-Overdrive/releases/tag/2020.3.4)

After downloading the starter-pack, unzip it and set the game-config.json bot to our bot directory. It should be

`the_directory_you_cloned/src/az-bot-v4-superior`

After that, simply run the game runner.

Windows users:

`./run.bat`

Unix users:

`make run`
